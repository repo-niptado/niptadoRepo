3. Fills comprehensive complaint form
4. System generates Level 1 escalation email
5. Initial complaint submitted and tracked

### **Escalation Process**
1. **Automatic Escalation** (Cron-based)
   - System monitors escalation timing
   - Automatically triggers next level when due
   - Generates appropriate escalation email
   - Updates complaint status

2. **Manual Follow-up**
