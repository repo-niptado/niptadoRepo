Subject: FINAL ESCALATION - Executive Intervention Required - ${complaint.level1_subject} - External Action Pending

Dear ${company.name} Executive Team,

This communication serves as my final attempt to resolve a significant complaint through internal channels before pursuing external remedies under consumer protection laws.

The Issue: ${complaint.level1_issue_summary}

Failed Internal Process:
Your organization has failed to:
- Provide timely responses to legitimate customer concerns

- Demonstrate commitment to customer satisfaction
- Follow basic customer service standards

Final Resolution Demand:
I request immediate executive intervention to resolve this issue, including:
${complaint.level1_requested_action}

Deadline for Response:
Respond within 3 business days or I will escalate externally via:
- Government regulators

I trust your office will resolve this matter responsibly.

Sincerely,  
${user.name}

${new Date().toDateString()}
