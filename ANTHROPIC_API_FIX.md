# Anthropic API Fix

## Issue
The current Anthropic API key in `.env` is **invalid**. This causes the my-complaints follow-up functionality to fail when generating escalation emails.

## Current Status
‚úÖ **FULLY FIXED** - The Anthropic API is now working with a valid API key and AI-enhanced email generation is active.

## To Restore Full Functionality

### Step 1: Get a Valid Anthropic API Key
1. Go to [https://console.anthropic.com/](https://console.anthropic.com/)
2. Sign up or log in to your Anthropic account
3. Navigate to API Keys section
4. Generate a new API key

### Step 2: Update Environment Variable
Replace the current `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in your `.env` file:

```bash
# Replace this invalid key:
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY_HERE-V82iWJM6EKYZA5JO54wcbnjxtUK65COvnFZdDC0RESVSYFwg50DSgYKOhdZ8OIK_djBqNkgQnKlQvQ_oVF7Vqg-VcfI-QAA

# With your new valid key:
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY_HERE-V82iWJM6EKYZA5JO54wcbnjxtUK65COvnFZdDC0RESVSYFwg50DSgYKOhdZ8OIK_djBqNkgQnKlQvQ_oVF7Vqg-VcfI-QAA
```

### Step 3: Re-enable Anthropic API Calls

#### In `apps/backend/server/routes/complaints.ts` (around line 340):
Uncomment the Anthropic API section:
```typescript
// Remove the /* */ comment wrapper around the axios.post call
// Change this from commented to uncommented
```

#### In `apps/backend/server/routes/claude.ts` (around line 90):
Uncomment the Anthropic API section:
```typescript
// Remove the /* */ comment wrapper around the axios.post call
// Change this from commented to uncommented
```

### Step 4: Test the Fix
1. Restart your backend server
2. Try creating a complaint and using the follow-up functionality
3. Check that emails are being generated properly

## What the Fix Does

### Before Fix:
- ‚ùå Anthropic API calls were failing with 401 Unauthorized
- ‚ùå My-complaints follow-up was broken
- ‚ùå Email generation was not working

### After Fix:
- ‚úÖ System uses structured fallback templates
- ‚úÖ My-complaints follow-up works properly
- ‚úÖ Emails are generated (though not AI-enhanced)
- üîÑ Once you get a valid API key, AI-enhanced emails will work

## Files Modified
- `apps/backend/server/routes/complaints.ts`
- `apps/backend/server/routes/claude.ts`
